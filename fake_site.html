  <p>Here is a quote from wikipedia:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine">
    Italian cuisine (Italian: Cucina italiana, pronounced [ku&apos;tʃiːna ita&apos;ljaːna])
    is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking
    techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later
    spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora.

  <h3>How to Cook Dried Pasta, Step-by-Step</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Step 1: Boil Water</dt>
    <dd>Start with a very large pot of water, about 6 quarts per pound of pasta. Bring it to a rapid boil.</dd>
    <dt>Step 2: Add Salt</dt>
    <dd>Put in a lot of salt, about 3 tablespoons. If you taste the water, it should taste like the sea.</dd>
    <dt>Step 3: Add the Pasta</dt>
    <dd>Drop in the pasta while the water is at a boil and give it a gentle stir.</dd>
    <dt>Step 4: Stir</dt>
    <dd>Stir it occasionally while it cooks. Use the cooking time on the pasta package as a guide.</dd>
    <dt>Step 5: Taste the Pasta</dt>
    <dd>But watch out — it's hot! Sample the pasta at about 2 minutes shy of the indicated time. It should be al dente. You'll finish cooking it in the sauce.</dd>
    <dt>Step 6: Drain</dt>
    <dd>Drain the pasta. Just be sure to save about 1 cup of the pasta water. If you have a pot with a colander insert, use it to drain the pasta. If not, drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink.</dd>
    <dt>Step 7: Removing Ravioli</dt>
    <dd>If you're cooking ravioli, use a slotted skimmer and gently lift the ravioli a few at a time.</dd>
    <dt>Step 8: Stir In the Sauce</dt>
    <dd>Add the pasta to your sauce and finish cooking it in the sauce. Give it a stir to coat.</dd>
    <dt>Step 9: Add Pasta Water</dt>
    <dd>Ladle a few tablespoons of the pasta water at a time until you have the right consistency to your sauce. Remember, the pasta will absorb the liquid. Tip: Pasta water helps to thicken the sauce.</dd>
    <dt>Step 10: Buon Appetito!</dt>
    <dd>Simmer over medium-low heat — it'll help the pasta soak up the sauce. Follow your recipe's instructions for finishing the dish. And that's all there is to it. Perfecto!</dd>
